Pro Tips
--------

-  You don't need to go to every talk. Look through the schedule of
   events before you arrive or while you are eating or taking a break.
   Figure out which talks you want to see the most. Spread out your time
   between talks, networking, and breaks.

-  Speaking of breaks--conferences are exhilarating, but can also be
   exhausting. Give your brain a break! Grab a quiet spot in the Backstage Lounge
   or take a quick walk. Play a board game on your lunch break. Come
   back invigorated.

-  Eat! You can use the energy.

-  Are you looking for a job or is there an opening at your company?

**Where is everything?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pre-registration event takes place at ?? on Sunday, January 21st, 2018 at
6 PM. More details to come.

The main conference takes place in Granville Island Stage at `1585 Johnston
Street.
<https://www.google.com/maps/place/1585+Johnston+St,+Vancouver,+BC+V6H+3R9,+Canada>`_.

The sprints on Wednesday, January 24th, is at a **different** venue:
`#400 - 455 Granville Street.
<https://www.google.com/maps/place/455+Granville+St,+Vancouver,+BC+V6C+1T1,+Canada>`_.

**How should I get around?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vancouver has a very useful `public transit system
<https://www.tourismvancouver.com/plan-your-trip/getting-around/transit-system/>`_.
The majority of the must-see places are in its reach. There are buses, trains, and
ferries available. There are also two private companies that operate small ferries
across False Creek.

At the moment, there is no ridesharing service like Uber or Lyft in Vancouver. We
highly recommend using public transit.

**How should I dress?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Vancouver is a casual-dress town and so is the PyCascades
   conference. You'll be meeting business colleagues at this conference,
   though, so neat and comfortable are good dress guidelines.

-  This time of year, the
   Pacific Northwest tends to be muddy or raining with occasional swaths
   of blue skies. Layering is usually the way to go.

**What's the weather like?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The weather is mosty mild. You can expect temperatures in the mid 40's Fahrenheit
  (0ยบ to 5ยบ Celsius) during the conference dates. It gets fairly wet, but snow is not
  usually a problem. `Read more <https://www.tourismvancouver.com/vancouver/weather/>`_.

**What will I eat?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Drinks and snacks are provided for you on conference days, so you can
   focus on the talks and meeting people and don't have to worry about
   where to get your morning coffee.

-  Coffee, tea, and water are always available in the Backstage Lounge.
   Bring a water bottle to make it easier for you to stay hydrated.

-  Lunch is not provided. It will be a great opportunity to try out a variety
   of food options at `Granville Island Public Market
   <http://granvilleisland.com/food-and-drink>`_.

-  In the evening, explore Vancouver's amazing food scene. Invite
   someone you just met to join you! If you are invited to dinner, say
   yes! Making connections over dinner is a great way to get to know
   more people.

-  If you need grocery items, there is ??

**Places to eat**

- `Storm Crow <https://www.stormcrowalehouse.com/>`_


**Where should I sit?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  There are no reserved seats; feel free to sit anywhere.

-  If you can, show up early to the conference each morning to grab a
   seat inside the theatre. Introducing yourself to your
   neighbors is one of the easiest way to meet people.

**What should I do during the talks?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Talks schedule <https://www.pycascades.com/schedule/>`_.

-  The time between talks is for meeting your colleagues or taking a
   break. During the talks, listen and take in as much as you can.

-  There is a lot of great information at this conference, but don't
   worry if you miss something! All talks are videotaped, so you can
   review them later.

-  If you have a question during a talk, make a note of it and use it as
   a conversation starter with the speaker.

-  After a talk, feel free to tweet about it with the hashtag
   #pycascades. Try not to "watch" the conference through Twitter and
   other social media, though. You are attending the conference, so live
   in it as much as you can!


**What are lightning talks, and should I give one?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Lightning talks will take place on both main conference days, right
   after lunch, from 1:50PM to 2:20 PM.
   
-  A lightning talk is a five-minute talk where you quickly share a
   concept or bit of info you find interesting.

-  Lightning talks are a great way to practice public speaking, get
   people excited about your personal projects, and test interest in
   a conference proposal idea.

-  Do you have an idea, want to talk about a new tool you are learning,
   or review a process? Then, yes! Sign up for a lightning talk. There
   will be a sign-up sheet at registration.

-  If you are interested in giving a lightning talk, be prepared! There
   is a great guide
   `here <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2017/lightning-talks/?highlight=re>`_.

**How do I make the most out of this conference?**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make connections with other first-time attendees and get advice from seasoned pros.

The most important part of this conference (and any conference) is the
people you meet. Set a goal for yourself to meet a few, new people. Here
are some tips:

-  Find out who is attending the conference before you get there. Join
   the `PyCascades Slack <http://pycascades-slack.herokuapp.com/>`_, follow
   `PyCascades on Twitter <https://twitter.com/pycascades>`_,
   and review the `list of
   talks <https://www.pycascades.com/talks/>`_.

-  Figure out which companies will be represented at the conference. If
   you see a job post you're interested in, you might want to ask them a
   few questions. This might be a great time to better understand what
   it's like to work at certain companies.

-  Make a list of a few people you would like to meet, and write down
   some questions for them. If you can find contact information, email
   them before the conference and let them know you are looking forward
   to chatting.

-  Most importantly, remember that you don't have to meet everyone. In
   fact, you shouldn't. You should plan to make a few, meaningful
   connections. That is what the PyCascades conference is about, so
   go for it! Introduce yourself.

**Sample strategy for my first PyCascades conference**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Join the `PyCascades Slack <http://pycascades-slack.herokuapp.com/>`_,
   and participate in the Welcome Wagon chat room to start making
   conference connections.

-  Make a list of two people who are attending with some notes about
   them and questions for them. Either reach out by email before the
   conference to set up a meeting onsite or find them at the conference.

-  Attend the sprints and volunteer to help on one of the projects being worked on.

-  Check out the talk schedule in advance and make note of the talks you
   don't want to miss.

-  Check out the lightning talks, and get excited about presenting one
   at next year's conference.

**Sample strategy for a second or higher conference**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Reach out to some first-time attendees and tell them about your first
   conference.

-  Attend the sprints with your own project. Ask for help!

-  Check out the talk schedule in advance and make note of the talks you
   don't want to miss.

-  Sign up for a lightning talk.
