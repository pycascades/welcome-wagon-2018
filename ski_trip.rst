Ski Trip
========

Near Vancouver, Whistler is one of the world’s premier ski destinations. In 2010,
it was a venue for the XXI Olympic Winter Games. About 15 to 20 PyCascades attendees
are planning on visiting Whistler-Blackcomb the weekend before our conference
opens for skiing, snowboarding, and other snow activities.

Many hotels and Airbnb hosts in Whistler require a three day minimum booking for
a weekend. One member of our community was able to book with Executive Inn for a
two day booking for Saturday and Sunday. Since Whistler is a world class ski
destination, lodging can be expensive. An option is to stay in Squamish and
drive to Whistler daily for skiing. It’s a 47 minutes drive each way.

Example pricing on lodging in Whistler is Mountain Side Hotel Whistler by
Executive, $338 a night. In Squamish, Mountain Retreat Hotel is $87 a night.
Hotels.com describes both as 3-star hotels.

If you choose to stay in Squamish, there may be others you may carpool with.
Another option is Cypress Mountain only a 39 minute drive from Vancouver centre.
Lift tickets for Cypress Mountain is only $60 compared to Whistler-Blackcomb’s
price of $92.21. Whistler lift ticket price is an online purchase made seven
days in advance.
